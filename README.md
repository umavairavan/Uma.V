#RetailStore
I have made this program simple using a single class.
Just Run the Retail.java file.
User has to enter details according to the program demands.
#Discount Criteria below 
If the user is an employee of the store he gets 90% discount.
If the user is an affiliate of the store he gets 50% discount.
if the user is an customer of the store for 1 years he gets 25% discount.
For every $200 on the bill, there would be a $25 discount(e.g for $990,you get $25 as a discount)
Percentage based discounts does not apply on groceries.
User can get only one percentage discount on the bill.
